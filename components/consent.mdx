We undertake not to use the images in any way that would misrepresent the intent of the Attendee’s participation.  I understand that if I have any questions about data collection, storage, processing, or sharing, I can get more information by emailing: privacy@firstinspires.org

## ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY

The risks and dangers of attendance may include, without limitation, injury or illness resulting from attendance and other activities associated with attendance in the program including traveling to and from FIRST events.

The Parent/Guardian of an Attendee under 18 years of age acknowledges and agrees that the Parent/Guardian is primarily responsible for the Attendee’s safety and that the Parent/Guardian will monitor, as appropriate, the Attendee’s participation in the Championship.

I acknowledge that attendance is voluntary, and may subject Attendees to personal injury, property damage or loss, and/or death. I have considered the risks of attending  and give my informed consent for myself and/or my child to attend the FIRST® LEGO® League OPEN AFRICA CHAMPIONSHIP.

I hereby release FIRST South Africa, its directors, officers, employees, Program Delivery Organizations and/or Program Delivery Partners, specifically including, (but not limited to, the entities listed here), agents, contractors, volunteers, vendors, other Attendees and any other third party working on behalf of FIRST South Africa  or in support of FIRST South Africa, from any and all liability arising from or related to attending the FIRST® LEGO® League OPEN AFRICA CHAMPIONSHIP.
